--- STEPS FOR GETTING SETTING UP THE DB AND THE TABLE ---
-- (1) Move datafile into HDFS: hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal [path to local source file] [path to target directory]
-- (2) In hive, create the database: create database [database name];
-- (3) In hive, create an empty table with columns appropriate for whatever data you plan to store.
--- For example:
---- create table genderStats(countryname string, countryabbr string, info string, infoabbr string, y1960 string, y1961 string, 
----                          y1962 string, y1963 string, y1964 string, y1965 string, y1966 string, y1967 string, y1968 string, 
----                          y1969 string, y1970 string, y1971 string, y1972 string, y1973 string, y1974 string, y1975 string, 
----                          y1976 string, y1977 string, y1978 string, y1979 string, y1980 string, y1981 string, y1982 string, 
----                          y1983 string, y1984 string, y1985 string, y1986 string, y1987 string, y1988 string, y1989 string, 
----                          y1990 string, y1991 string, y1992 string, y1993 string, y1994 string, y1995 string, y1996 string, 
----                          y1997 string, y1998 string, y1999 string, y2000 string, y2001 string, y2002 string, y2003 string, 
----                          y2004 string, y2005 string, y2006 string, y2007 string, y2008 string, y2009 string, y2010 string, 
----                          y2011 string, y2012 string, y2013 string, y2014 string, y2015 string, y2016 string) 
----                          ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde' 
----                          WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ("separatorChar" = ",", "quoteChar" = "\"") 
----                          STORED AS TEXTFILE;
-- (4) Load the file into the empty table: 
--- For loading from HDFS: load data inpath '[path in HDFS]' into table genderStats;
--- For loading from local: load data local inpath '[path in local file system]' into table genderStats;
-- (5) You're done!
